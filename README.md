Grimoire
=================

> "Even the most powerful wizard must consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness."

Grimoire is community web documentation of the Clojure programming language intended to provide an up to date replacement for ClojureDocs by documenting current versions of Clojure and to augment Clojure's documentation by hosting examples and extended docs.
