Grimoire
=================

> "Even the most powerful wizard must consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness."

Grimoire is community web documentation of the Clojure programming
language intended to provide an up to date replacement for ClojureDocs
by documenting current versions of Clojure and to augment Clojure's
documentation by hosting examples and extended docstrings.
