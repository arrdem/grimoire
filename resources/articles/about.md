Grimoire was hacked in 24hrs by [Reid McKenzie](http://arrdem.com/) and [César Bolaños](https://github.com/cesarbp), and serves to provide web documentation of the [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) language with community contributed commentary and examples.

Since then, Grimoire has continued to evolve and with thanks to now features examples sourced from [ClojureDocs](http://clojuredocs.org) as well as user submitted content.

Grimoire version `0.3.0` was made possible by [Robert Stuttaford](https://github.com/robert-stuttaford), who helped port Grimoire from the original Jekyll static site to a real Clojure webapp and for whose assistance we are immensely grateful.

Grimoire, while free to you, isn't free to operate.
At present, running Grimoire costs about $10 a month to keep online and gets much more than that in on-going development time.
As I'm still in school, if you find yourself using Grimoire routinely I'd ask that you [support the project](https://www.gittip.com/arrdem) by helping me cover the hosting and coffee costs of keeping it online and useful.
